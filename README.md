<h1>‚ö†Ô∏è Notice</h1>

CuteMusic is currently in its first versions, which means: 

- You may want to keep your main music player for now, as CM lacks some features notably metadata editing and may be unstable!
- ANY bug reports / issues will be taken into consideration
- Code might messy/incomprehensible. Cleanup will be done as time goes on

I'm not perfect, I have school, a personnal life, hard times etc... I may not be able to bring bug fixes & features immediately, but will do my best to do so.
