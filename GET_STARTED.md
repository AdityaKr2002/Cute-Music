### Code Guidelines

CuteApps currently don't have alot of guidelines, but it is best if you follow the few ones they have such as :

- Clutter-free experience : This is self explanatory, avoid adding elements if un-needed, two example could be :
    - flashing music icon : The music icon in the searchbar flashes red, indicating that it is clickable / has an action related to it
    - the restart button, the seek to previous automatically becomes one 10 seconds in the song instead being a whole new button which brings us to the next guideline :
 - Make things clear : If you are adding a feature, make sure it is clear of what it does, clear text/description, accurate icon
 - Landscape : CuteApps <b>MUST</b> be fully compatible with landscape mode, if you are adding any screen, make sure it has a landscape variant, otherwise your PR will be ignored
 - Creativity : This isn't mandatory, but if you are designing a screen or something else, be creative ! Try things no other apps has before, be unique ! Remember, failure is just a step closer to perfection !
